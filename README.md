Apache Bigtop (http://bigtop.apache.org/)
======

...is a project for the development of packaging and tests of the Apache Hadoop (http://hadoop.apache.org/) ecosystem.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
The primary goal of Apache Bigtop is to build a community around the packaging and interoperability testing of Apache Hadoop-related projects. This includes testing at various levels (packaging, platform, runtime, upgrade, etc...) developed by a community with a focus on the system as a whole, rather than individual projects.

Quick overview of source code for Apache Bigtop.
=========================================

* __bigtop-deploy__ : deployment scripts, puppet stuff, VM utilities for Apache Bigtop.
    * __bigtop-packages__ : RPM/DEB specifications for Apache Bigtop subcomponents
* __bigtop-test-framework__ : The source code for the iTest utilities (framework used by smoke tests).
* __bigtop-tests__ : 
* __test-artifacts__ : source for tests.
* __test-execution__ : maven pom drivers for running the integration tests found in test-artifacts.
* __bigtop-toolchain__ : puppet scripts for setting up an instance which can build Apache Bigtop, sets up utils like jdk/maven/protobufs/...

Also, there is a new project underway, Apache Bigtop blueprints, which aims to create templates/examples that demonstrate/compare various Apache Hadoop ecosystem components with one another.

Contributing 
============

There are lots of ways to contribute, people with different expertise can help with various subprojects:
    
* __puppet__ : Much of the Apache Bigtop deploy and packaging tools use puppet to bootstrap and setup a cluster. But recipes for other tools are also welcome (ie. Chef, Ansible, etc.)
* __groovy__ : Primary language used to write the Apache Bigtop smokes and itest framework. 
* __maven__ : Used to build Apache Bigtop smokes and also to define the high level Apache Bigtop project. 
* __RPM/DEB__ : Used to package Apache Hadoop ecosystem related projects into GNU/Linux installable packages for most popular GNU/Linux distributions. So one could add a new project or improve existing packages.
* __hadoop__ : Apache Hadoop users can also contribute by using the Apache Bigtop smokes, improving them, and evaluating their breadth.
* __contributing your workloads__ : Contributing your workloads enable us to tests projects against real use cases and enable you to have people verifying the use cases you care about are always working
* __documentation__ : We are always in need of a better documentation!
* __giving feedback__ : Tell us how you use Apache Bigtop, what was great and what was not so great. Also what are you expecting from it and what would you like to see in the future?
 
    Also opening JIRA's https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BIGTOP and getting started by posting on the mailing list is helpful.

What do people use Apache Bigtop for? 
==============================

You can go to the Apache Bigtop website : http://bigtop.apache.org/ for notes on how to do "common" tasks like

  * Apache Hadoop App developers: Download an Apache Bigtop built Apache Hadoop 2.0 VM from the website, so you can have a running psuedodistributed Apache Hadoop cluster to test your code on.
  * Cluster administers or deployment gurus: Run the Apache Bigtop smoke tests to ensure that your cluster is working.
  * Vendors: Build your own Apache Hadoop distribution, customized from Apache Bigtop bits.

Getting Started
===============

Below are some recipes for getting started with using Apache Bigtop. As Apache Bigtop has different subprojects, these recipes will continue to evolve.  
For specific questions its always a good idea to ping the mailing list at dev-subscribe@bigtop.apache.org to get some immediate feedback, or open a JIRA : https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BIGTOP

For Users: Running the tests 
----------------------------

WARNING: since testing packages requires installing them on a live system it is highly recommended to use VMs for that. Testing Apache Bigtop is done using iTest framework. The tests are organized in maven submodules, with one submodule per Apache Bigtop component.  The bigtop-tests/test-execution/smokes/pom.xml defines all submodules to be tested, and each submodule is in its own directory under smokes/, for example:
 
*smokes/hadoop/pom.xml*
*smokes/hive/pom.xml*
*... and so on.*
 
* Step 1: Build the smokes with snapshots.  This ensures that all transitive dependencies etc.. are in your repo

        mvn clean install -DskipTests -DskipITs -DperformRelease -f ./bigtop-test-framework/pom.xml
        mvn clean install -DskipTests -DskipITs -DperformRelease -f ./test-artifacts/pom.xml

* Step 2: Now, rebuild in "offline" mode.  This will make sure that your local changes to bigtop are embeded in the changes.

        mvn clean install -DskipTests -DskipITs -DperformRelease -o -nsu -f ./bigtop-test-framework/pom.xml
        mvn clean install -DskipTests -DskipITs -DperformRelease -o -nsu -f ./bigtop-tests/test-artifacts/pom.xml
 
* Step 3: Now, you can run the smoke tests on your cluster.
    * Example 1: Running all the smoke tests with TRACE level logging (shows std out from each mr job). 
      
        mvn clean verify -Dorg.apache.bigtop.itest.log4j.level=TRACE -f ./bigtop/bigtop-tests/test-execution/smokes/pom.xml 

    * Just running hadoop examples, nothing else.

        mvn clean verify -D'org.apache.maven-failsafe-plugin.testInclude=**/*TestHadoopExamples*' -f bigtop-tests/test-execution/smokes/package/pom.xml
 
    Note: A minor bug/issue: you need the "testInclude" regular expression above, even if you don't want to customize the tests, 
    since existing test names don't follow the maven integration test naming convention of IT*, but instead, follow the surefire (unit test) convention of Test*.

For Users: Creating Your Own Apache Hadoop Environment 
-----------------------------------------------

Another common use case for Apache Bigtop is creating / setting up your own Apache Hadoop distribution.  
For details on this, check out the bigtop-deploy/README.md file, which describes how to use the puppet repos
to create and setup your VMs.  
There is a current effort underway to create vagrant/docker recipes as well, which will be contained in the 
bigtop-deploy/ package.     


For Developers: Building the entire distribution from scratch
-------------------------------------------------------------
 
Packages have been built for CentOS/RHEL 5 and 6, Fedora 18, SuSE Linux Enterprise 11, OpenSUSE12.2, Ubuntu LTS Lucid and Precise, and Ubuntu Quantal. They can probably be built for other platforms as well. Some of the binary artifacts might be compatible with other closely related distributions.
 
__On all systems, Building Apache Bigtop requires the following tools__

* All systems need these tools installed to build bigtop:

  Java JDK 1.6, Apache Forrest 0.8, Apache Ant, Apache Maven, git, subversion, autoconf, automake, liblzo2-dev, libz-dev, sharutils, libfuse-dev, libssl-dev

* Additionally, some details for specific linux versions :
  * __Debian__ based distros need these packages : build-essential dh-make debhelper devscripts, reprepro
  * __openSUSE 11.4__ needs these packages : relaxngDatatypedocbook-utils docbook-simple, asciidoc, fuse-devel, docbook5, docbook5-xsl-stylesheets, libxml2-devel, xmlformat, xmlto, libxslt, libopenssl-devel

* __Building packages__ : 

        make [component-name]-[rpm|deb]

* __Building local YUM/APT repositories__ : 

        make [component-name]-[yum|apt]
